# OSIRIS-REx_PSFD
Internship work for the NASA Arizona Space Grant Consortium on NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission

This project analyzes the particle size frequency distribution (PSFD) of a 6.4-gram aggregate Bennu sample, named OREX-800107-0. We used various convolutional neural networks for image processing for particle segmentation of X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data and imported the segmentation into a custom Python script. The code identifies the particles as isolated islands and computes the longest axis of each particle for the PSFD. Additional functions are used to determine other size properties.
This project is in collaboration with Dr. Andrew Ryan from the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, Dr. Zack Gainsforth from the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California Berkeley, and the scientists from the spatial, physical, and thermal analysis working group (SPTAWG) of the OSIRIS-REx Sample Analysis Team.
